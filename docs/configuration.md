## Config Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` | OpenCode core settings (plugin registration, providers) |
| `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json` | Plugin settings - agents, multiplexer, MCPs, council |
| `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.jsonc` | Same, but with JSONC (comments + trailing commas). Takes precedence over `.json` if both exist |
| `.opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim.json` | Project-local overrides (optional, higher precedence than user config) |

> **💡 JSONC recommended:** Use the `.jsonc` extension to add comments and trailing commas. If both `.jsonc` and `.json` exist, `.jsonc` takes precedence.

Set `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` to use a custom user config directory instead of
`~/.config/opencode`; install and runtime config discovery both honor it.

Set `OH_MY_OPENCODE_SLIM_DISABLE` to `1`, `true`, `yes`, or `on` to make
oh-my-opencode-slim return during startup without registering agents, tools,
MCPs, hooks, Companion, or the TUI sidebar. This is a temporary escape hatch:

```bash
OH_MY_OPENCODE_SLIM_DISABLE=1 opencode
```

If OmO-slim detects an invalid plugin config for the current project, the TUI sidebar shows a warning. Run `oh-my-opencode-slim doctor` from your project root for full diagnostics.

Marketplace agent packages are selected through the active preset's
`marketplace` configuration. The CLI and orchestrator tools update desired
disk state only; they do not mutate the current session's agent registry. See
the [Marketplace guide](marketplace.md) for activation, status, and reload
commands.

The TUI sidebar uses the compact layout by default. Set `compactSidebar` to
`false` in `oh-my-opencode-slim.jsonc` to use the expanded layout:

```jsonc
{
  "compactSidebar": false
}
```

Click the `OMO-Slim` heading to collapse or expand its sidebar section. It
starts expanded; the choice lasts for the current TUI window only. An idle
agent has a `•` before its name. While an agent session reports `busy` or
`retry`, an animated Braille indicator replaces the bullet in the same spot.
The bullet returns after every active session for that agent becomes idle or
is deleted.

In an expanded agent list, `⚰` marks a stopped session (no terminal result); only `task_revive` can continue it.

---

### Built-in MCP precedence

On OpenCode v1 and v2, built-in MCPs (`context7` and `gh_grep`) are
defaults: the plugin only supplies entries whose names are absent from the
host MCP configuration. Define an entry in OpenCode's `opencode.json` or
`opencode.jsonc` to replace a built-in server. The entire entry is preserved,
including its URL, headers, timeout, OAuth settings, or local command;
fields from the built-in definition are not merged into it.

An explicit `{ "enabled": false }` entry is also preserved. You do not need
to add a server to `disabled_mcps` just to customize its connection settings.
`disabled_mcps` prevents built-in injection and excludes those names from
plugin agent MCP grants; it does not delete user-defined host MCP entries.
Per-agent MCP permissions still apply independently of connection settings.

## Prompt Overriding

Customize agent prompts without modifying source code. Create markdown files in `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim/`:

| File | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `{agent}.md` | Replaces the agent's default prompt entirely |
| `{agent}_append.md` | Appends custom instructions to the default prompt |

When a `preset` is active, the plugin checks preset directories before falling back to root directories. Both global user prompt directories and project-local prompt directories are searched. For the complete lookup precedence order, see [Project-local Customization](project-local-customization.md).

**Example directory structure:**

```
~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim/
  ├── best/
  │   ├── orchestrator.md        # Preset-specific override (used when preset=best)
  │   └── explorer_append.md
  ├── orchestrator.md            # Fallback override
  ├── orchestrator_append.md
  ├── explorer.md
  └── ...
```

Both `{agent}.md` and `{agent}_append.md` can coexist - the full replacement takes effect first, then the append. If neither exists, the built-in default prompt is used.

> **Prompt text is verbatim for delegation vocabulary.** The plugin never
> rewrites delegation calls in prompts, so any delegation calls you write must
> use the running host's vocabulary — v1 `task`/`subagent_type`/`task_id`, v2
> `subagent`/`agent`/`sessionID`. This applies to prompt files, inline
> `agents.<agent>.prompt`, and `orchestratorPrompt` snippets. Separately,
> display-name substitution rewrites `@<internalName>` mentions to the agent's
> `displayName` when one is defined, throughout the final orchestrator prompt
> (inline, file, and append orchestrator prompts) and in
> `orchestratorPrompt`/ACP routing snippets. See
> [Host Vocabulary in Custom Prompts](project-local-customization.md#host-vocabulary-in-custom-prompts).

---

## JSONC Format

All config files support **JSONC** (JSON with Comments):

- Single-line comments (`//`)
- Multi-line comments (`/* */`)
- Trailing commas in arrays and objects

**Example:**

```jsonc
{
  // Active preset
  "preset": "openai",

  /* Agent model mappings */
  "presets": {
    "openai": {
      "oracle": { "model": "openai/gpt-6-astra" },
      "explorer": { "model": "openai/gpt-6-luna" },
    },
  },

  "multiplexer": {
    "type": "tmux",
    "layout": "main-vertical",
  },
}
```

## Full Option Reference

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `preset` | string | - | Active preset name (e.g. `"openai"`, `"best"`) |
| `stripOrchestratorModel` | boolean | `false` | Preserve a runtime `/model` selection for the orchestrator after subagent dispatch by omitting its configured model from the SDK config. A selected preset's explicit `orchestrator.model` is retained. Without a runtime selection, this opt-in delegates the initial orchestrator choice to OpenCode's session default. |

### Runtime Preset Switching

Presets can also be selected from the TUI with `/preset`. The selection is
written to the user config file. On v2 hosts the write requests the live
refresh: after the server-side watcher has re-read the config, the
saved/applied preset's inference fields (`model`, `variant`, `temperature`,
`options`) apply to **new child dispatches** (frozen for each child before
its first request) and the sidebar. Every existing session and every
non-inference preset field (`prompt`, `tools`, `permission`, `skills`,
`mcps`, `displayName`) stays frozen until a full reload. A malformed config
is rejected before any swap — the last-known-good profiles and sidebar are
kept until the config is fixed. The TUI reports `Saved … Live refresh
requested` (it cannot observe the server-side watcher); fix the config and
reload if new dispatches still use the old fields. On v1 hosts, reload
OpenCode for the change to take effect. See
[Preset Switching](preset-switching.md) for details.

| `presets` | object | - | Named preset configurations. New preset names are limited to letters, digits, `-`, and `_`; `__omo_*` and JavaScript reserved property names (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`) are rejected for new presets (pre-existing entries with other names stay visible and applicable) |
|-----------|--------|---|-----------------------------|
| `presets.<name>.extends` | string | - | Optional single parent preset. The parent is resolved before the child; multiple parents are not supported |
| `presets.<name>.<agent>.model` | string | - | Model ID in `provider/model` format |
| `presets.<name>.<agent>.temperature` | number | - | Optional temperature (0–2); when omitted, OpenCode chooses its default |
| `presets.<name>.<agent>.variant` | string | - | Reasoning effort: `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"`, or `"max"` (provider-specific) |
| `presets.<name>.<agent>.displayName` | string | - | Custom user-facing alias for the agent (e.g. `"advisor"` for `oracle`) |
| `presets.<name>.<agent>.color` | string | - | Agent display color as `#RRGGBB` or a theme color: `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `success`, `warning`, `error`, or `info` |
| `presets.<name>.<agent>.skills` | string[] | - | Skills the agent can use (`"*"`, `"!item"`, explicit list) |
| `presets.<name>.<agent>.skills_add` | string[] | - | Skill names added to the effective skills list at config resolution (applies to `agents.<agent>` entries too). Removal via `skills_remove` wins. Folded into `skills` and stripped; see [Skills Assignment](skills.md#adding-or-removing-skills-on-top-of-an-inherited-list) |
| `presets.<name>.<agent>.skills_remove` | string[] | - | Skill names removed from the effective skills list at config resolution (applies to `agents.<agent>` entries too). Wins over `skills_add`. Folded into `skills` and stripped; see [Skills Assignment](skills.md#adding-or-removing-skills-on-top-of-an-inherited-list) |
| `presets.<name>.<agent>.mcps` | string[] | - | MCPs the agent can use (`"*"`, `"!item"`, explicit list) |
| `presets.<name>.<agent>.options` | object | - | Provider-specific model options passed to the AI SDK (e.g., `textVerbosity`, `thinking` budget) |
| `agents.<customAgent>.model` | string\|array | - | Required for custom agents inferred from unknown `agents` keys |
| `agents.<customAgent>.prompt` | string | - | Full execution prompt for a custom agent |
| `agents.<customAgent>.orchestratorPrompt` | string | - | Exact `@agent` block injected into the orchestrator prompt; must start with `@<agent-name>` |
| `agents.<agent>.permission` | object \| string | - | Tool-level permission rules enforced by the SDK. See [Agent Permissions](#agent-permissions) |
| `agents.<agent>.mcps` | string[] | - | Plugin MCP allow-list (`"*"`, `"!item"`, explicit list); this is plugin configuration, not a host agent `mcps` field |
| `agents.<agent>.displayName` | string | - | Custom user-facing alias for the agent in the active config |
| `agents.<agent>.color` | string | - | Agent display color as `#RRGGBB` or a theme color: `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `success`, `warning`, `error`, or `info` |
| `agents.<agent>.description` | string | generated | Description shown to OpenCode and the orchestrator; defaults to `Custom subagent '<name>'` for custom agents |

The plugin's `agents.<agent>.mcps` setting controls which configured plugin MCP
servers its policy allows. It is not a host-native `agent.mcps` property and
does not replace host permission rules: an explicit host permission denial for
an MCP tool remains authoritative.
| `acpAgents.<name>.command` | string | - | Command for an external ACP-compatible agent; creates a wrapper subagent named `<name>` See [ACP-connected agents](#acp-connected-agents). |
| `acpAgents.<name>.args` | string[] | `[]` | Arguments for the ACP agent command See [ACP-connected agents](#acp-connected-agents). |
| `acpAgents.<name>.env` | object | `{}` | Extra environment variables for the ACP subprocess See [ACP-connected agents](#acp-connected-agents). |
| `acpAgents.<name>.cwd` | string | session directory | Working directory override for this ACP subprocess; protocol paths should be absolute See [ACP-connected agents](#acp-connected-agents). |
| `acpAgents.<name>.description` | string | - | Description shown to OpenCode and injected into the orchestrator routing prompt See [ACP-connected agents](#acp-connected-agents). |
| `acpAgents.<name>.prompt` | string | generated wrapper prompt | Optional full prompt for the lightweight wrapper subagent See [ACP-connected agents](#acp-connected-agents). |
| `acpAgents.<name>.orchestratorPrompt` | string | generated routing block | Optional exact routing block injected into the orchestrator prompt See [ACP-connected agents](#acp-connected-agents). |
| `acpAgents.<name>.wrapperModel` | string | orchestrator default | Cheap OpenCode model used by the wrapper subagent that calls `acp_run` See [ACP-connected agents](#acp-connected-agents). |
| `acpAgents.<name>.permissionMode` | string | `ask` | How ACP permission requests are handled: `ask`, `allow`, or `reject` See [ACP-connected agents](#acp-connected-agents). |
| `acpAgents.<name>.timeoutMs` | integer | `0` | Timeout for a single ACP run in milliseconds. `0` disables the timeout so external agents can run indefinitely. Finite values can be up to `2147483647`ms (~24.8 days) See [ACP-connected agents](#acp-connected-agents). |
| `disabled_agents` | string[] | `["observer"]` | Agent names to disable globally. Set to `[]` to enable Observer; this is global, not per-preset See [Custom Agents](#custom-agents). |
| `image_routing` | `"auto"` \| `"direct"` | omitted (legacy conditional) | Optional. When omitted, resolves to `"auto"` if Observer is enabled, otherwise `"direct"`. Explicit `"auto"` saves image attachments under `.opencode/images/<session>/` and nudges delegation to @observer; saved images remain until you remove them. `"direct"` always passes image parts to the orchestrator. Remove saved images with `rm -rf .opencode/images/` (or a single session subdirectory) when they are no longer needed; session-less messages save images at the top level. |
| `autoUpdate` | boolean | `true` | Automatically install plugin updates in the background; set to `false` for notification-only mode |
| `multiplexer.type` | string | `"none"` | Multiplexer mode: `auto`, `tmux`, `zellij`, `herdr`, `cmux-tui`, `kitty`, or `none` See [Multiplexer Integration](multiplexer-integration.md). On OpenCode v2 hosts, panes work with the shared background service or an explicit `--server`; `--standalone` hosts ignore the setting (one diagnostic per process). |
| `multiplexer.layout` | string | `"main-vertical"` | Layout preset: `main-vertical`, `main-horizontal`, `tiled`, `even-horizontal`, `even-vertical`. Each adapter maps it to its nearest native expression (tmux full layouts; split directions for Zellij/Herdr; built-in layouts for kitty); cmux-tui has no layout expression and ignores it. See [Multiplexer Integration](multiplexer-integration.md#layouts). |
| `multiplexer.main_pane_size` | number | `60` | Main pane size as percentage (20–80) for tmux main layouts; ignored by Zellij, Herdr, kitty, and cmux-tui See [Multiplexer Integration](multiplexer-integration.md#layouts). |
| `multiplexer.cmux_tui_binary` | string | omitted | Explicit path to the cmux-tui binary. When omitted, the client resolves `cmux-tui` first, then `cmux`, on `PATH` See [Multiplexer Integration](multiplexer-integration.md). |
| `multiplexer.zellij_pane_mode` | string | — | **Deprecated and ignored.** Zellij panes always open in the tab containing the parent OpenCode pane; a once-per-process warning is logged and pane management keeps working See [Behavior Changes and Removals](multiplexer-integration.md#behavior-changes-and-removals). |
| `tmux.enabled` | boolean | — | **Deprecated and ignored** (legacy key); use `multiplexer.type = "tmux"` See [Multiplexer Integration](multiplexer-integration.md#legacy-tmux-config). |
| `tmux.layout` | string | — | **Deprecated and ignored** (legacy key); use `multiplexer.layout` See [Multiplexer Integration](multiplexer-integration.md#legacy-tmux-config). |
| `tmux.main_pane_size` | number | — | **Deprecated and ignored** (legacy key); use `multiplexer.main_pane_size` See [Multiplexer Integration](multiplexer-integration.md#legacy-tmux-config). |
| `backgroundJobs.maxSessionsPerAgent` | integer | `2` | Maximum completed/reconciled reusable child sessions per specialist type in the current orchestrator session (1–10) See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `backgroundJobs.maxContextLines` | integer | `50000` | Maximum total context lines (sum of all tracked file line counts) for a session to remain reusable. Sessions exceeding this threshold are evicted from the reusable pool on completion See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `backgroundJobs.readContextMinLines` | integer | `10` | Minimum number of lines read from a file before it appears in reusable background-job context (0–1000) See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `backgroundJobs.readContextMaxFiles` | integer | `8` | Maximum number of recent read-context files shown per reusable child session (0–50) See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `backgroundJobs.maxRetainedSnapshots` | integer | `20` | Maximum board snapshots retained per checkpoint cache epoch (1–100). Adding a snapshot beyond the limit starts a new epoch with only the current snapshot, intentionally creating one cache miss See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `backgroundJobs.strategy` | `"latest"` \| `"checkpoint-compatible"` | `"latest"` | `latest` freezes one board part per eligible turn and replays earlier parts without a cap; unchanged boards use a short marker for up to nine turns, then a full board (terminal results always get a full board). Parts disappear on process restart, compaction, revert, or session deletion. For long-lived processes, `checkpoint-compatible` appends only changed boards and bounds retention per cache epoch with `backgroundJobs.maxRetainedSnapshots` See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `backgroundJobs.orchestratorWake.enabled` | boolean | `true` | When true, idle orchestrator sessions with incomplete todos may receive periodic internal wake prompts (default every 5 minutes of continuous parent idle). Requires host session APIs. See [Background Orchestration](background-orchestration.md#orchestrator-wake-scheduler) See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `backgroundJobs.orchestratorWake.intervalMs` | integer | `300000` | Continuous parent-idle interval between wake evaluations (`60000`–`2147483647` ms). `0` is invalid. See [Background Orchestration](background-orchestration.md#orchestrator-wake-scheduler) See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `backgroundJobs.orchestratorWake.mode` | string | `"auto"` | Wake-condition source: `"auto"` uses todo-gating on OpenCode v1 and children-driven degraded mode on v2 hosts; `"todo"`/`"children"` pin one mode (explicit `"todo"` degrades to children where no todo API exists). See [Background Orchestration](background-orchestration.md#orchestrator-wake-scheduler). |
| `backgroundJobs.orchestratorWake.wakeOnTerminalPublication` | boolean | `true` | When true, a terminal completed/error publication that reaches an idle parent wakes it immediately instead of waiting for the next periodic evaluation. The first terminal publication of any generation (terminalRevision 1) is skipped (the native notifier armed by that generation's `subagent` tool call already delivers it); busy parents are skipped the same way See [Background Orchestration](background-orchestration.md#orchestrator-wake-scheduler) See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `backgroundJobs.orchestratorWake.publicationWakeMinIntervalMs` | integer | `30000` | Per-parent minimum spacing between terminal-publication wakes (`1000`–`2147483647` ms; `0` is invalid — the schema floor is 1,000ms). A burst of publications collapses into one wake; the window is consumed only when a wake is actually delivered See [Background Orchestration](background-orchestration.md#orchestrator-wake-scheduler) See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `backgroundJobs.wallClockTimeoutMs` | integer | `0` | **Opt-in wall-clock supervisor.** `0` disables it. Otherwise, only native background child sessions (`task(..., background: true)` on v1, `subagent(..., background: true)` on v2) are supervised; accepted values are `60000`–`2147483647` milliseconds See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `backgroundJobs.abortGraceMs` | integer | `10000` | Grace period after a wall-clock deadline for a terminal confirmation. Accepted values are `1000`–`60000` milliseconds; a hanging or failed abort does not extend this grace See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `backgroundJobs.stopConfirmationMs` | integer | `5000` | Terminal-gate grace period the background-job terminal gate waits for stop confirmation evidence before publishing a stopped job. Accepted values are `1000`–`60000` milliseconds See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `backgroundJobs.concurrency.defaultConcurrency` | integer | `0` | Maximum concurrently running native background tasks. `0` means unlimited; accepted values are `0`–`1000` See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `backgroundJobs.concurrency.providerConcurrency` | object | `{}` | Per-provider caps keyed by provider ID. Each value must be `0`–`1000`, where `0` means unlimited for that provider. The most specific configured cap wins: model > provider > default See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `backgroundJobs.concurrency.modelConcurrency` | object | `{}` | Per-model caps keyed by `provider/model` ID. Each value must be `0`–`1000`, where `0` means unlimited for that model. The most specific configured cap wins: model > provider > default See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `backgroundJobs.sameProviderPolicy` | object | `{}` | Opt-in per-provider policy keyed by provider ID; the only value is `"foreground"`. When the parent session's current model and the child agent's resolved model both resolve to a configured provider, an explicit background call (`task(..., background: true)` on v1, `subagent(..., background: true)` on v2) is converted to the existing foreground execution path. Unconfigured, different, or undeterminable providers keep background behavior. See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `backgroundJobs.waitForUserGuard` | boolean | `true` | When true, intercepts `wait_for_user` calls while background tasks are still running and the orchestrator wake scheduler is enabled, returning guidance to end the turn instead of blocking on manual input. See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `backgroundJobs.boardInjection` | boolean | `true` | When false, the Background Job Board reminder is never injected into prompts. Background task tracking, wake, and task_status all keep working; the orchestrator simply no longer passively sees the board. See [Background Job Management](#background-job-management). |
| `disabled_mcps` | string[] | `[]` | Built-in MCP server IDs to skip injecting and exclude from plugin agent MCP grants; user-defined host MCP entries are preserved |
| `disabled_tools` | string[] | `[]` | Slim tool names to disable globally. Disabled Slim tools are not registered with OpenCode and cannot be used by agents; OpenCode built-in tools are not affected |
| `disabled_skills` | string[] | `[]` | Skill names to disable globally. Disabled skills are not granted to agents, and disabled bundled skills are not registered; listing `reflect` here also disables the `/reflect` command |
| `disabled_hooks` | string[] | `[]` | Hook names to disable globally: `"phase-reminder"` stops orchestrator phase-reminder injection; `"foreground-fallback"` disables automatic foreground model fallback, same effect as `fallback.enabled = false`. Unknown values are stripped with a warning when the config loads; a value consisting only of unknown names is treated as unset, so a lower config layer's list still applies |
| `disabled_commands` | string[] | `[]` | Slash commands to disable globally: `"interview"`, `"deepwork"`, `"reflect"`, or `"loop"`. Disabled commands are neither registered nor intercepted at execution time, so a user-defined command with the same name is left untouched. Listing `reflect` in `disabled_skills` also disables the `/reflect` command. Unknown values are stripped with a warning when the config loads; a value consisting only of unknown names is treated as unset, so a lower config layer's list still applies |
| `fallback.enabled` | boolean | `true` | Enable Slim's foreground model-chain failover. It does not configure OpenCode provider/AI-SDK retries. On **v2 hosts** Slim's automatic foreground fallback is disabled regardless (temporary compatibility limitation: the v2 `switchModel` has no per-turn/atomic conditional form, so an in-flight switch could commit after a newer user turn has taken over). Host-native retries still run, but the configured chain is not executed automatically. Re-enable only once a host atomic conditional-switch capability is confirmed — not merely because a `switchModel` method exists. |
| `fallback.maxRetries` | number | `3` | Number of host retry events Slim absorbs before advancing the foreground model chain. The budget stays spent across model switches; a completed successful assistant response, an observed return to the configured primary for a fresh descent, or session deletion re-arms it. Terminal `session.error` and `message.updated` failures advance immediately without charging it. `0` advances on the first retry event. This does not configure OpenCode provider or background subagent retries. |
| `fallback.initialRetryDelayMs` | number | `0` | Delay in milliseconds before triggering the first fallback on a failover-worthy error. Gives intercepting plugins time to recover the current model before the fallback chain advances. 0 disables. |
| `fallback.retryDelayMs` | number | `500` | Delay in milliseconds between consecutive fallback attempts after the initial trigger. 0 disables. |
| `fallback.continuationPolicy` | `"retry-primary"` \| `"stick-to-fallback"` | `"retry-primary"` | OpenCode v1 policy for unpinned internal continuations after a confirmed fallback. `"retry-primary"` lets background-completion and lifecycle turns try the configured primary again; `"stick-to-fallback"` keeps them on the confirmed fallback until the next external user turn. |
| `council.presets` | object | - | **Required if using council.** Named councillor presets See [Council configuration note](#council-configuration-note). |
| `council.presets.<name>.<councillor>.model` | string | - | Councillor model See [Council configuration note](#council-configuration-note). |
| `council.presets.<name>.<councillor>.variant` | string | - | Councillor variant See [Council configuration note](#council-configuration-note). |
| `council.presets.<name>.<councillor>.prompt` | string | - | Optional role guidance for the councillor See [Council configuration note](#council-configuration-note). |
| `council.default_preset` | string | `"default"` | Default preset when none is specified See [Council configuration note](#council-configuration-note). |
| — | — | — | *Timeouts, execution mode, and retries are now handled by the orchestrator's council-mode prompt instructions; see `src/agents/council.ts`.* |
| `interview.maxQuestions` | integer | `2` | Max questions per interview round (1–10) See [Interview configuration](interview.md). |
| `interview.outputFolder` | string | `"interview"` | Directory where interview markdown files are written relative to the project root; absolute paths and `..` traversal are rejected See [Interview configuration](interview.md). |
| `interview.autoOpenBrowser` | boolean | `true` | Automatically open the interview UI in your default browser during interactive runs; suppressed in tests and CI See [Interview configuration](interview.md). |
| `interview.port` | integer | `0` | Interview server port (0–65535). `0` = OS-assigned random port (per-session mode). Any value > 0 enables [dashboard mode](interview.md#dashboard-mode) See [Interview configuration](interview.md). |
| `interview.dashboard` | boolean | `false` | Enable [dashboard mode](interview.md#dashboard-mode) on the default port (43211). Setting `port` > 0 also enables dashboard mode. If both are set, `port` takes precedence See [Interview configuration](interview.md). |
| `companion.enabled` | boolean | `false` | Enable/disable the floating window Rust companion See [Desktop Companion App](#desktop-companion-app). |
| `companion.binaryPath` | string | - | Optional path to a custom companion binary to launch instead of the default install path See [Desktop Companion App](#desktop-companion-app). |
| `companion.position` | string | `"bottom-right"` | The initial corner position of the companion window: `bottom-right`, `bottom-left`, `top-right`, or `top-left` See [Desktop Companion App](#desktop-companion-app). |
| `companion.size` | string | `"medium"` | The default size preset of the companion window: `small` (80px), `medium` (120px), or `large` (160px) See [Desktop Companion App](#desktop-companion-app). |

### Preset inheritance

Use `extends` to make a preset inherit from one base preset. The child can
override only the agents it needs to change:

```jsonc
{
  "presets": {
    "base": {
      "agents": {
        "orchestrator": { "model": "openai/gpt-6-sol" },
        "designer": { "model": "openai/gpt-6-luna" }
      }
    },
    "design": {
      "extends": "base",
      "agents": {
        "designer": { "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`design` keeps the base orchestrator model and replaces only the base
designer model. Presets support a single parent only; multi-parent
inheritance is not supported. For overlapping agent fields, precedence is:

**ancestor < child < root `agents` < host config**

Here, root `agents` means the plugin's top-level `agents` object, while host
config means the agent entry in OpenCode's `opencode.json`. A root `agents`
entry is global: it overrides the active preset, so do not put an agent there
if its value should vary by preset. Host config remains the final override.

The `/preset` TUI persists the selected preset name and does not create an
in-memory agent override. On v2 hosts the write requests the live refresh and
the re-resolved inference fields apply to new child dispatches (captured
before their first request) and the sidebar once the server-side watcher has
refreshed; existing sessions and the prompt/tool/permission/skill/MCP surfaces
stay frozen until a full reload. A malformed config keeps the last-known-good
profiles and sidebar and must be fixed (then reloaded) before the change can
apply. On v1 hosts, reload OpenCode after changing the active preset.

### ACP-connected agents

Use `acpAgents` to expose external Agent Client Protocol servers as optional
OpenCode subagents. The plugin creates a lightweight wrapper agent for each
entry. The wrapper calls the built-in `acp_run` tool, which starts the ACP
process, creates a session, sends the task, streams tool and plan progress to
the TUI while the agent works, and returns the final result.
`command` is only the executable; put flags and subcommands in `args`.

See **[ACP Agents](acp-agents.md)** for the dedicated setup guide, auth notes,
and troubleshooting.

```jsonc
{
  "acpAgents": {
    "claude-research": {
      "command": "claude-code-acp",
      "args": [],
      "description": "Claude Code subscription agent for deep research",
      "wrapperModel": "openai/gpt-6-luna",
      "permissionMode": "ask",
      "timeoutMs": 300000
    },
    "gemini-acp": {
      "command": "gemini",
      "args": ["--experimental-acp"],
      "description": "Gemini CLI through ACP"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Tip:** Use ACP to connect local agent CLIs. For example, `ollama` or `llama.cpp`
> can be exposed as ACP agents by wrapping them in a lightweight ACP adapter.

After restart, the orchestrator can delegate to `@claude-research` or
`@gemini-acp`. Use safe names matching `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$`; names cannot
conflict with built-in or custom agents. `permissionMode` controls ACP
permission requests, but the plugin still asks before launching the configured
subprocess.

### Council configuration note

- Councillor `model` and ACP `wrapperModel` values use `provider/model`
  references. The provider must be nonempty and cannot contain whitespace or
  `/`; the nonempty model remainder is retained verbatim and may contain spaces
  and nested `/` values, such as `opencode-omniroute-live/of/MiniMax M3`.
- The **Council agent model** is configured like any other agent, for example in
  `presets.<name>.council.model`.
- The **councillor models** are configured separately under
  `council.presets.<name>.<councillor>.model`.
- `council.master` (exact key) has been removed; a deprecation warning is
  logged if a config still contains it. Other `council.master_*` variants
  (e.g., `council.master_timeout`, `council.master_fallback`) are silently
  dropped without warning — remove them manually.

```jsonc
{
  "council": {
    "default_preset": "balanced",
    "presets": {
      "balanced": {
        "alpha": {
          "model": "openai/gpt-6-astra",
          "variant": "high"
        },
        "beta": {
          "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
          "variant": "medium"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Manual Update Mode

Set `autoUpdate` to `false` if you want update notifications without automatic
package installs.

```jsonc
{
  "autoUpdate": false
}
```

With `autoUpdate` set to `false`, this becomes notification-only mode: you'll
see that a new version is available, but the plugin won't install it
automatically.

Auto-update never crosses major versions. For example, a 1.x install can
auto-update to a newer 1.x release, but it won't auto-install 2.x. When a newer
major is available, the plugin shows a migration command instead.

> Pinned plugin entries in `opencode.json` (for example
> `"oh-my-opencode-slim@1.0.1"`) are the true version lock. Those stay pinned
> regardless of `autoUpdate`.

### Background Job Management

> The delegation tool named `task()` in the background-job material here is
> `subagent()` on v2, with `task_id`/`sessionID` as the matching resume id; bare
> `task()` mentions in this section refer to that host-specific delegation tool.

Background job management is enabled by default and does not need to be present
in the starter config. Add `backgroundJobs` only if you want to tune how many
completed/reconciled child-agent sessions are reusable, how much read context is
shown, how board snapshots are injected, or to change the default-on
orchestrator wake interval. For glossary definitions of background-job terms
(board snapshot, checkpoint cache epoch, injection strategy, etc.), see
[CONTEXT.md — Background Jobs](../CONTEXT.md#background-jobs).
The wall-clock supervisor is separately opt-in and remains disabled unless
`wallClockTimeoutMs` is set:

```jsonc
{
  "backgroundJobs": {
    "maxSessionsPerAgent": 3,
    "strategy": "checkpoint-compatible",
    "maxRetainedSnapshots": 10,
    "orchestratorWake": {
      "enabled": true,
      "intervalMs": 300000,
      "mode": "auto"
    },
    "wallClockTimeoutMs": 900000,
    "abortGraceMs": 10000,
    "concurrency": {
      "defaultConcurrency": 2,
      "providerConcurrency": {
        "openai": 2
      },
      "modelConcurrency": {
        "openai/gpt-6-luna": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`orchestratorWake` defaults to enabled with a 5-minute continuous-idle
interval and `"auto"` mode (todo-gated on v1 hosts, children-driven on v2).
Set `enabled: false` to keep idle reconciliation and background-job orchestration
without periodic wake prompts. See the
[Background Orchestration](background-orchestration.md) guide for the concept,
defaults, and examples.

`concurrency` limits only native background tasks with
`task(..., background: true)`. Foreground tasks are unchanged. A task waits
for admission before OpenCode creates its child session, so queued work does
not consume a provider request. `0` means unlimited.

Only the most specific configured cap applies to a task, matching the
reference implementation's priority: a model cap for the task's model wins
over a provider cap for its provider, which wins over the default cap. For
example, with `defaultConcurrency: 2`, `providerConcurrency: {"openai": 5}`
and `modelConcurrency: {"openai/gpt-4o": 10}`, up to 10 `openai/gpt-4o`
tasks run concurrently. Queued tasks are admitted in order among tasks whose
resolved cap has capacity. Terminal completion, cancellation, failure,
session deletion, and plugin disposal release the slot. A task that switches
models mid-flight (e.g. foreground model fallback) moves its accounting to
the new model. The scheduler is process-scoped: when the plugin re-inits on a
config update, running slots and queued tickets survive, so admission state
is not reset mid-run.

`sameProviderPolicy` is an opt-in per-provider policy for local inference
backends that execute multiple logical agent sessions on one shared
accelerator/model runtime. When a foreground parent and a same-provider
background child run concurrently on such a backend, throughput can degrade
from repeated model/KV context switching between the two large sessions.
When the parent session's current model and the child agent's resolved model
both resolve to a provider configured with `"foreground"`, the explicit
`task(..., background: true)` request is converted to the existing foreground
execution path:

```jsonc
{
  "backgroundJobs": {
    "sameProviderPolicy": {
      "lm-nexus": "foreground"
    }
  }
}
```

- Same provider with `"foreground"` configured → the background request is
  converted to foreground (no concurrency admission, no wall-clock
  supervision, synchronous host execution).
- Different providers → unchanged.
- Provider not configured → unchanged.
- Either provider undeterminable → unchanged (fail-open).

Default (omitted) behavior is unchanged. This does not change
`orchestratorWake` or `defaultConcurrency`/`providerConcurrency`/
`modelConcurrency` semantics: a converted task simply bypasses background
admission like any foreground task.

Two behaviors to know about when concurrency is enabled:

- Sessions that are themselves managed tasks (a background subagent
  orchestrating its own nested `task(..., background: true)` calls) are
  exempt from admission. They already hold a slot while running, so waiting
  for a second one would self-deadlock once the queue saturates.
- Admission has no timeout of its own. A running task that never reaches a
  terminal state keeps its slot forever, and queued tasks as well as the
  orchestrator's `task` calls block behind it. When you enable
  `concurrency`, pair it with an opt-in `wallClockTimeoutMs` so stalled
  tasks are eventually forced to a terminal state and release their slots.

Configurations that still use the removed `backgroundJobs.continueOnIdle` key
emit a deprecation warning and migrate its boolean value to
`orchestratorWake.enabled`. An `orchestratorWake.enabled` value in the same
config file takes precedence; replace the legacy key with that setting.

`wallClockTimeoutMs` is a hard deadline that only supervises explicitly
background native task calls; foreground calls or calls with `background`
omitted are not supervised. It is independent from OpenCode's external
task-wait timeout, and a wall-clock timeout cannot be recovered by reusing the
running session.

`fallback.maxRetries` is unrelated to the wall-clock supervisor and to
OpenCode's provider retry policy. A value of `0` allows no host retry events
before foreground failover; it does not prevent OpenCode from retrying a
provider request in a child session.

On v2 hosts, Slim's automatic foreground fallback is disabled entirely
(temporary compatibility limitation): the v2 `switchModel` has no per-turn /
atomic conditional form, so `session.error`, `message.updated` and
`session.status` retry cannot keep host and manager state consistent — an
in-flight switch could commit on the host after a newer user turn has taken
over. Host-native retries and their decisions are left untouched, but the
configured fallback chain is not executed automatically. This must only be
re-enabled once a host atomic conditional-switch capability is confirmed, not
merely because a `switchModel` method exists.

### Agent Display Names

Use `displayName` to give an agent a user-facing alias while keeping the
internal agent name unchanged.

```jsonc
{
  "agents": {
    "oracle": {
      "displayName": "advisor"
    },
    "explorer": {
      "displayName": "researcher"
    }
  }
}
```

With this config, users can refer to `@advisor` and `@researcher`, while the
plugin still routes them to `oracle` and `explorer` internally.

Notes:

- `displayName` works in both top-level `agents` overrides and inside `presets`
- `@` prefixes and surrounding whitespace are normalized automatically
- Display names must be unique
- Display names cannot conflict with internal agent names like `oracle` or `explorer`

### Independent agent model inheritance

By default, the `fixer` agent inherits the `librarian` model when no fixer
model is configured. To decouple agents, set `inheritModelFrom` on the agent
that should follow the current session or the configured orchestrator model:

```jsonc
{
  "agents": {
    "librarian": {
      "model": "ollama/qwen3.8:27B"
    },
    "fixer": {
      "inheritModelFrom": "session"
    }
  }
}
```

Supported values are:

- `session`: omit the agent model so OpenCode uses the current session model
- `orchestrator`: follow the live orchestrator/session model, including later
  fallback switches

`orchestrator` inheritance remains live when the orchestrator changes models.
Delegated agents therefore follow the active fallback model rather than
starting on a stale primary and waiting for an avoidable provider failure.
Their own configured model array remains the ordered fallback chain after the
inherited active model.

Array-configured specialists also avoid a provider the orchestrator has
already fallen past. When the parent's active fallback is present in the
child's chain, that exact entry is used. Otherwise Slim prefers the child's
first entry on the working parent provider, then the first entry outside the
providers exhausted by the parent. OpenCode v2 uses the native per-call
subagent model override. OpenCode v1's `task` tool has no model argument, so
Slim sets the selected model on the child's first prompt before the host saves
it. In both cases the delegation keeps the canonical specialist name, so
`task` permission rules and the task tool's agent list are unchanged. On v1,
`fallback.continuationPolicy` controls what happens when an unpinned native
background-completion or lifecycle turn follows a confirmed fallback. The
default, `"retry-primary"`, lets the host try the configured primary again,
which is useful after a quota or provider outage is repaired. Set it to
`"stick-to-fallback"` to keep those internal continuations on the confirmed
fallback until the next external user turn.

Model selection follows these rules:

- If the same effective agent override contains both a scalar `model` and
  `inheritModelFrom`, the explicit `model` wins.
- If `model` is omitted, `inheritModelFrom` is an explicit higher-layer
  directive: it clears a lower-layer `model` value, including a model supplied
  by the host agent configuration, and resolves the requested source.
- If the same effective agent override contains both an **array** `model`
  (an ordered fallback chain) and `inheritModelFrom`, the two combine: the
  agent follows the session/orchestrator model, and the array serves as the
  fallback chain tried when that model fails. See
  [Following the session model with a fallback chain](#following-the-session-model-with-a-fallback-chain).
- If neither field is present, the existing model precedence and the historical
  fixer-to-librarian fallback remain unchanged.

The setting works in both root `agents` overrides and preset agent overrides.

#### Following the session model with a fallback chain

Combine `inheritModelFrom` with an array `model` when a subagent should
prefer the main agent's current model — including manual `/model` switches —
but still survive that model dying (rate limit, quota, outage):

```jsonc
{
  "agents": {
    "oracle": {
      "model": ["anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6", "openai/gpt-6"],
      "inheritModelFrom": "session"
    }
  }
}
```

At launch the agent inherits the session model instead of the chain head.
When a failover-worthy error hits, the runtime chain is
`[<current session model>, ...configured chain]`: the live model is never
re-picked, the first configured entry takes over, and later entries follow in
order. Chain exhaustion stays bounded — after the whole chain fails once, one
re-fallback round runs on the last entry, then the session aborts instead of
looping. A `/model` pick on such an agent is its follow target; it never
disables the fallback chain.

An inline `variant` on the first chain entry belongs to that entry's model.
When inheritance makes the agent follow the session model, the inline variant
is cleared at both the agent layer and the final host config — the followed
model must not run with a variant meant for a fallback model. Set an explicit
agent-level `variant` if you want one regardless of the followed model.

Do not combine an array `model` with `inheritModelFrom: "session"` on the
`orchestrator` itself. The orchestrator *is* the session: every config pass
would clear the host-persisted model selection (including a manual `/model`
pick) with nothing to follow, leaving the orchestrator without a stable
configured model. Use a plain array `model` on the orchestrator and combined
policies on subagents.

### Agent Colors

Built-in agents ship without a default `color`, so the OpenCode TUI assigns
each one a distinct color from its own theme-aware palette. Set `color`
explicitly if you want a fixed color for a built-in or custom agent, using a
six-digit hex value or an OpenCode theme color:

```jsonc
{
  "agents": {
    "oracle": { "color": "#FF5733" },
    "reviewer": {
      "model": "openai/gpt-6",
      "color": "info"
    }
  }
}
```

Theme colors adapt to the active OpenCode theme. Dynamic councillors inherit
the configured `council` color unless `agents.councillor.color` overrides it.
`color` works in top-level `agents` overrides and inside `presets`.

### Per-preset agent configuration

To get per-preset behavior for any agent, built-in (`council`, `oracle`,
`explorer`, `librarian`, `fixer`, `designer`, `observer`) or custom, define
the agent override inside each preset block, not in root `agents`.

```jsonc
{
  "presets": {
    "balanced": {
      "council": { "model": ["opencode/mimo-v2.5-free", "opencode-go/minimax-m3", "opencode/minimax-m3"] },
      "oracle": { "model": "opencode/big-pickle", "variant": "high" },
      "skeptic": { "model": ["opencode/big-pickle", "opencode-go/qwen3.7-plus"], "variant": "max" }
    },
    "nvidia-free": {
      "council": { "model": ["nvidia/z-ai/glm-5.2", "nvidia/moonshotai/kimi-k2.6"] },
      "oracle": { "model": "nvidia/deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-pro", "variant": "high" },
      "skeptic": { "model": ["nvidia/deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-pro", "nvidia/mistralai/mistral-large-3-675b-instruct-2512"], "variant": "max" }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Agent precedence

For overlapping agent fields, the effective precedence is:

**ancestor < child < root `agents` < host config**

An ancestor supplies defaults, the child preset overrides them, the plugin's
top-level `agents` object overrides the active preset, and the agent entry in
OpenCode's `opencode.json` is the final override. A root `agents` entry is
global rather than per-preset, so put an agent inside each preset when its
value should vary by preset. This precedence also applies after `/preset`
selects a preset; `/preset` persists the selection and does not create an
in-memory override.

#### Sharing a prompt across presets (custom agents)

A custom agent with a long prompt does not need the prompt duplicated into
every preset block. Put the prompt in a file and define the agent in each
preset with only `model` (and `variant` if needed):

1. Create `<projectDir>/.opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim/<agentName>.md` with
   the shared prompt.
2. In each preset block, define the agent with only the model fields (no
   `prompt`):

```jsonc
{
  "presets": {
    "balanced": {
      "skeptic": { "model": ["opencode/big-pickle", "opencode-go/qwen3.7-plus"], "variant": "max" }
    },
    "nvidia-free": {
      "skeptic": { "model": ["nvidia/deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-pro", "nvidia/mistralai/mistral-large-3-675b-instruct-2512"], "variant": "max" }
    }
  }
}
```

`loadAgentPrompt` (`src/config/loader.ts:418`) is preset-aware and reads
`<agentName>.md` from the `oh-my-opencode-slim/` prompts directory. Lookup
order:

1. `<projectDir>/.opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim/<preset>/<agentName>.md` (project, preset-specific)
2. `<projectDir>/.opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim/<agentName>.md` (project, preset-agnostic)
3. `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim/<preset>/<agentName>.md` (user, preset-specific)
4. `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim/<agentName>.md` (user, preset-agnostic)

A preset block without `prompt` falls back to the file prompt (if one
exists), not to a root `agents.<name>.prompt`. The project-level paths (1
and 2) work universally and are the recommended location for shared
prompts. User-level paths (3 and 4) can collide with a plugin install
symlink if `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode-slim/` is symlinked to the
plugin source.

> **⚠️ Known limitation (#899):** Prompt files take precedence over inline
> prompts everywhere — not just in presets, but also in root `agents`.
> If you set an inline `prompt` in a preset or in root `agents` and a
> prompt file exists for that agent, the inline prompt is silently dropped

> pattern above is the safe path: keep the prompt in the file, and put
> only `model`/`variant` in the config. Do not mix an inline `prompt`
> with a prompt file for the same agent.

### Custom Agents

Unknown keys under `agents` are treated as custom subagents. A custom agent needs
its own `model`, a normal `prompt`, and optionally an `orchestratorPrompt` that
teaches the orchestrator exactly when to delegate to it.

```jsonc
{
  "agents": {
    "janitor": {
      "model": "github-copilot/gpt-6",
      "prompt": "You are Janitor. Audit codebase entropy, dead code, docs drift, naming inconsistencies, and unnecessary complexity. Prefer analysis and plans over direct edits.",
      "orchestratorPrompt": "@janitor\n- Role: Maintenance specialist for codebase cleanup and entropy reduction\n- **Delegate when:** after large refactors • cleanup/technical-debt review • dead code or docs drift is suspected\n- **Don't delegate when:** feature implementation • urgent debugging • UI/UX work"
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:

- Custom agent names must be safe identifiers such as `janitor` or `security-reviewer`
- Custom agents without a `model` are skipped with a warning
- Disabled custom agents are not registered or injected into the orchestrator prompt

> **Tip:** Keep `orchestratorPrompt` concise — the orchestrator reads it every turn.
> Include: when to delegate, when NOT to delegate, and the agent's role in one paragraph.

### Agent Permissions

The `permission` field provides deterministic, tool-level permission restrictions on custom agents, built-in agent overrides, and presets. Unlike prompt instructions ("do not edit files"), these rules are enforced by the OpenCode SDK at the tool-call level.

The field accepts either:

1. **Shorthand string** — `"ask"`, `"allow"`, or `"deny"` applied to all tools
2. **Object** — keys are tool names, values are `"ask" | "allow" | "deny"` or (for rule keys) a pattern-to-action map

**Example: read-only `planner` agent:**

```jsonc
{
  "agents": {
    "planner": {
      "model": "openai/gpt-5.5",
      "variant": "high",
      "skills": [],
      "mcps": ["context7", "gh_grep"],
      "permission": {
        "edit": "deny",
        "bash": {
          "*": "ask",
          "git status*": "allow",
          "git diff*": "allow",
          "grep *": "allow"
        },
        "webfetch": "allow",
        "websearch": "allow", // opencode's built-in websearch tool, not a plugin MCP
        "task": "deny"
      },
      "prompt": "You are Planner. Create implementation plans only. Do not implement code."
    }
  }
}
```

**Example: `security-reviewer` agent:**

```jsonc
{
  "agents": {
    "security-reviewer": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
      "permission": {
        "edit": "deny",
        "bash": "deny",
        "webfetch": "allow"
      },
      "prompt": "You are a security reviewer. Inspect code and report findings. Do not patch anything."
    }
  }
}
```

#### Permission keys

| Key | Value type | Description |
|-----|------------|-------------|
| `read` | string or object | File reading |
| `edit` | string or object | File editing |
| `glob` | string or object | File pattern matching |
| `grep` | string or object | Content search |
| `list` | string or object | Directory listing |
| `bash` | string or object | Shell command execution |
| `task` | string or object | Subagent task delegation |
| `external_directory` | string or object | Access to directories outside the workspace |
| `lsp` | string or object | Language server protocol operations |
| `skill` | string or object | Skill execution |
| `todowrite` | string only | Todo list writing |
| `question` | string only | Asking the user questions |
| `webfetch` | string only | Web content fetching |
| `websearch` | string only | Web search |
| `codesearch` | string only | Code search |
| `doom_loop` | string only | Doom loop prevention |

Keys marked "string or object" accept pattern-based rules (e.g. `bash: { "git status*": "allow", "*": "ask" }`). Keys marked "string only" accept a single `"ask"`, `"allow"`, or `"deny"` value. Unknown tool names (including MCP-derived keys) pass through without error.

#### Merge semantics

When a user supplies `permission` and also uses the `skills` or `mcps` arrays on the same agent, the plugin merges them:

1. **User-supplied `permission` is the base layer.**
2. **Plugin-generated rules from the `skills` array override `permission.skill`** — the `skills` array is authoritative for skill gating.
3. **Plugin-generated rules from the `mcps` array set `permission.<mcp>_*` keys** — the `mcps` array is authoritative for MCP gating.
4. **User-supplied keys for standard tools** (`edit`, `bash`, `webfetch`, `task`, etc.) survive the merge untouched.

Use the `skills`/`mcps` arrays for skill and MCP gating. Use `permission` for everything else (file access, bash, web, task delegation).

### Multiplexer

The multiplexer hosts child agent sessions in terminal panes. See [Multiplexer Integration](multiplexer-integration.md) for backend setup, layout configuration, and troubleshooting. On OpenCode v2 hosts, panes work when the TUI uses the shared background service or an explicit `--server` URL; `--standalone` hosts cannot host panes (`multiplexer.type` is ignored there with one diagnostic per process).

### Desktop Companion App

The desktop companion app provides a visual status overlay showing running and active agents. For quick installation instructions, binary paths, config defaults, and release information, see the full **[Desktop Companion Guide](companion.md)**.

Once installed, configure it in your `oh-my-opencode-slim` settings:

```jsonc
{
  "companion": {
    "enabled": true,
    "position": "bottom-right", // optional: bottom-right, bottom-left, top-right, top-left
    "size": "medium"            // optional: small, medium, large
  }
}
```
